To Do List Project:

-Overview-

Welcome to the To Do List application. Here, users are able to add new tasks to their to do list, view their tasks, mark task as completed, and delete tasks.

To use this application, start at the beginning with the menu. Here, users can use '1' to add a new task, '2' to view their tasks, '3' to mark a task as completed', '4' to delete a task, and '5' to exit out of the menu. 

For marking a task as completed and deleting a task, please input the task number. For example, if you want to delete "3. going to the gym", instead of typing out gym, type "3" and it will either mark the task as completed or delete it.

If a task has been completed, it will say "completed" in green. If not, "incomplete" will pop up in red. In order to have a task marked as completed, type in '3' to go to the completed list. Type in the number of task you want to mark off as completed, and it will pop up as completed.
